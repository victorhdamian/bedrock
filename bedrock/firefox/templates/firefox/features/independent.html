          Firefox is built by a non-profit. That means we can do things that others can’t,
          like build new products and features without a hidden agenda. We champion your
          right to privacy with tools like Private Browsing with Tracking Protection,
          which go beyond what Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge offer.
